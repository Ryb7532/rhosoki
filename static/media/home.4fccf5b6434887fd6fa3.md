## About Me

I'm a PhD student in Department of Mathematical and Computing Science at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

My research interests are in distributed deep learning, especially 3D hybrid parallelism combined with pipeline model parallelism, tensor model parallelism and data parallelism, and Auto-partitioning of DNN model.

## Keywords

Model parallelism, Pipeline parallelism, Tensor(Operator) parallelism, 3D parallelism, Auto-partitioning of DNN model
