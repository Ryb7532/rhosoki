## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student in Dept. of Mathematical and Computing Science at Institute of Science Tokyo (Formerly, Tokyo Institute of Technology).

My research interests are in distributed deep learning, especially 3D parallelism combined with pipeline model parallelism, tensor model parallelism and data parallelism, and Auto-parallelization of deep learning.

## Keywords

Model parallelism, Pipeline parallelism, Tensor(Operator) parallelism, 3D parallelism, Auto-parallelization of deep learning
